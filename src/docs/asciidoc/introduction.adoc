= Introduction

[NOTE]
Please note that this documentation is still under construction.  There are a
lot of missing pieces.

Client-side Java development took a major step forward with the introduction of
Oracle's http://www.javafx.com[JavaFX] library. JavaFX is a modern, rich client
technology stack that enables Java developers to quickly and easily create
desktop clients with functionality and richness that rival, and even surpass,
that of native clients and web applications.

GroovyFX is a library that makes working with JavaFX much simpler and more
natural. GroovyFX is focused on exploiting the power of the
http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy] language to make JavaFX development easier
and more concise than what is possible in Java. GroovyFX also leverages Groovy's
powerful DSL features and AST transformations to eliminate boilerplate, making
GroovyFX code easier to write and, just as importantly, easier to read.

GroovyFX provides the SceneGraphBuilder object, which offers support for:

* All of the JavaFX core controls
* All of the core JavaFX layout containers
* Shapes, colors, and gradients
* Video and audio (including H.264 support)
* Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and the rest of core JavaFX charts
* Full property and binding support
* The @FXBindable annotation, which eliminates the boilerplate required to
  define JavaFX properties

All of these are made easy to use through the power of the language and the
extensive use of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs).  This documentation will take
you from getting started with GroovyFX all the way to building full applications
with the power of JavaFX and Groovy.
