= Getting Started

== What's New in Version 0.4.0
GroovyFX version 0.4 includes support for Groovy 2.3, Java 8, and JavaFX 8.

== What's New in Version 0.2.0
GroovyFX version 0.2 has a number of fixes, new functionality, and other
enhancements.  This includes some changes that are incompatible with version
0.1.  See the Breaking Changes section below for details on these changes.

=== Improvements
The following JavaFX 2.1 and 2.2 features have been added:

* DirectoryChooser
* ComboBox
* StackedBarChart and StackedAreaChart
* Canvas

Other improvements:

* Usage of Node IDs
* Actions
* Nested Table Column Support
* onSelect Pseudo-Property Added to ListView, TreeView, ComboBox, ChoiceBox,
  and TabPane
* Cell Factory Support

=== Breaking Changes

The following changes are not backwards compatible with previous versions.

* New usage of GroovyFX and SceneGraphBuilder classes
* New Binding
* TimelineBuilder went away

== Installation Requirements
Before installing GroovyFX you will need to install the Java Development Kit
(JDK) version 1.6 or above.

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp[Download the appropriate JDK] for your
operating system, run the installer, and then set up an environment
variable named JAVA_HOME pointing to the location of this installation.

== Using the GroovyFX Library
There are several ways in which you can include GroovyFx in your projects.

=== Maven Central

Having GroovyFX in Maven Central (thanks to Sonatype's OSS hosting!) makes it
simple to use GroovyFX in everything from simple test scripts to larger
projects.  The Maven coordinates are as follows

* _groupId_: org.codehaus.groovyfx
* _artifactId_: groovyfx
* _version_: 0.4.0

GroovyFX is simple to inlude in Groovy scripts thanks to Groovy's Grab
annotation, a part of the Grape system.  Just include the following line at the
top of your script

[source,groovy]
Testing.groovy
@Grab('org.codehaus.groovyfx:groovyfx:0.4.0')

=== Creating a GroovyFX-Based Project with Gradle

It is also simple to set up your own GroovyFX-based project using Gradle as the
build system.  This sample build.gradle script will get you started.

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin:'groovy'

project.ext.set('javaHome', System.env['JAVA_HOME']

repositories { mavenCentral() }

dependencies {
    compile 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.3.7'
    compile 'org.codehaus.groovyfx:groovyfx:0.4.0'
    compile files("${javaHome}/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar")
}

task run(type: JavaExec) {
    main = 'helloGroovyFX'
    classpath sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}

task makeDirs(description:'make all dirs for project setup') << {
    def sources = [sourceSets.main, sourceSets.test]
    sources*.allSource*.srcDirs.flatten().each { File srcDir ->
        println "making $srcDir"
        srcDir.mkdirs()
    }
}

task wrap(type:Wrapper, description:"create a gradlew") {
    gradleVersion = '2.1'
}
----

Just create a new directory for your project and place the gradle script into
it.  Then simply call

[source,groovy]
gradle makeDirs

to set up the rest of your project's directory structure.  You will
automatically have a dependency on both Groovy and GroovyFX.

== Building from Source

The project's source code is located on
https://github.com/groovyfx-project/groovyfx[GitHub].  You can clone the
GroovyFX repository using the following http://git-scm.com/[Git] command

[source]
git clone git://github.com/groovyfx-project/groovyfx.git

=== Installation Requirements

If you are using a JDK prior to Java 7u4, you will need to install the JavaFX
2.x SDK from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/index.html[javafx.com].
Once you have downloaded and installed the SDK, set up an environment variable
called JAVAFX_HOME pointing to the location of the JavaFX SDK.

[NOTE]
The JavaFX 2.1 SDK is included in Java 7u4 and above.  If you are using this
version of the JDK, you do not need to install a separate SDK and set the
JAVAFX_HOME environment unless you would like to use a different version of the
JavaFX SDK than the one included in your JDK.

=== Building with Gradle
GroovyFX uses http://www.gradle.org[Gradle] as its primary build system.
Building the project with Gradle requires only the following simple steps

[source]
cd groovyfx
gradlew build

The Gradle build script is also capable of running any of the project's demo.
To run any specific demo, e.g.the AccordionDemo, you can just use

[source]
gradlew AccordionDemo

To see an executable overview of all build tasks including all demos

[source]
gradlew --gui

=== Building with Intellij IDEA

GroovyFX's build script is capable of generating all of the project files
neccessary to build the project with Intellij IDEA.  Just run the following
command from the project's root directory

[source]
gradlew idea

This will generate a groovyfx.ipr file.  From IDEA, select File -> Open Project
and navigate to the directory containing the groovyfx.ipr file and open it.  You
should now be able to build the library and run the demos with IDEA.

=== Building with NetBeans

The NetBeans project files are included in the code repository.  You may have to
set up a Java Platform that includes the JavaFX SDK directory, if one does not
already exist. Please see
http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/javafx-setup.html[Setting Up NetBeans IDE With
JavaFX 2.1] for more information.

Once you have created the JavaFX enabled Java platform, then choose the GroovyFX project,
right click and pick "Properties". Choose the "Libraries" entry, then choose the
JavaFX enabled Java Platform. You should now be able to build the library and run the demos with NetBeans.
Also, you may have to fix the location for the groovy-all jar file.

== Hello GroovyFX: Your First GroovyFX Program
Once you have everything set up, try the following Groovy script to test that your setup is functioning as it should.

[source,groovy]
----
@Grab('org.codehaus.groovyfx:groovyfx:0.2')

import static groovyx.javafx.GroovyFX.start

start {
    stage(title: 'GroovyFX Hello World', visible: true) {
        scene(fill: BLACK, width: 500, height: 250) {
            hbox(padding: 60) {
                text(text: 'Groovy', font: '80pt sanserif') {
                    fill linearGradient(endX: 0, stops: [PALEGREEN, SEAGREEN])
                }
                text(text: 'FX', font: '80pt sanserif') {
                    fill linearGradient(endX: 0, stops: [CYAN, DODGERBLUE])
                    effect dropShadow(color: DODGERBLUE, radius: 25, spread: 0.25)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

If everything runs correctly you should see the following screen appear.
